summary: Seniply is an ergonomic, minimal keyboard layout for a keyboard with at least 34 keys. The minimum requirement is 30 keys in the main body plus 4 thumb-keys. All the features (and more) of a standard full-size keyboard are available by making use of six layers, which are activated via the thumb keys. The default base layer is Colemak-DH.
